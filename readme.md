# VisiPrompt – Where Words Create Images!

## A tool that Converts text prompts into AI-generated images instantly.

This project is a Text-to-Image Generator built with React (frontend) and a Node.js/Express backend. The app allows users to enter a text prompt, which is sent to the backend for image generation. The backend processes the request using Stable Diffusion (or another AI model like DALL·E, depending on your implementation) and returns the generated image URL to the frontend for display.
